# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of Design Choices
When designing a solution for the task we began to look at it from a 3rd person perspective to break down what the task actually was and how we would do it while meeting rubric goals. After this we landed on doing the Maze challenge. Now to complete the challenge we opened up the Finch java library to see and learn the basics of coding the Finch. After reviewing the library we found out how to move and rotate with simple method commands that we then used to complete the maze. Due to the overall randomness and lack of patterns within the maze, we did not make a loop, which meant we had to hard code each movement rather than tell it to move and then turn a couple times.

## Challenges Faced and Solution
Some challenges we faced while working was adapting to the new workspace, finding measurements, and making sure to place our Finch down correctly when testing.The VS code workspace gave us some early challenges as we were unfamiliar with navigation and connecting it to gitub as well as our Finch. When calculating movements, we needed to see how long we wanted our Finch to move as the movement method was based on centimeters, to find the measurements we used rulers and at one pint a yard stick to measure turns that were then converted from inches into centimeters. When coding after implementing the measurements we began to test and while testing we found that our code generally worked but errors would occur while testing due to its placement on the maze.
## Future Enhancements
If we were given more time we'd familiarize ourselves more with VS code and the Finch robots themselves. After this we think making loops for the maze or possibly making movement based upon an if statement would be on a higher level and would be more impressive. To do this we would utilize its sensors and try to make turns or forward movement based on how close it might feel something is. Based upon our current knowledge we cannot provide an example of how we might make it move backwards but after more experience we hope to have a solution to that.
